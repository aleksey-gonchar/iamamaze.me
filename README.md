## Installation & running

```
npm i
```

Before running server you need to create local git ignored secrets.json

```
npm run init
```

Build dev bundle and run dev server:

```
npm run build
npm start
```

Build prod bundle and run prod server:

```
npm run build-prod
npm run start-prop
```

## Explanation
Express app is wrapped in basic http server in order to be easy extended. E.g. to use sockets.
On the top of entry point `server.js` `babel/register` is included for server side render of client es6 modules in [redux-handler.js](https://github.com/aleksey-gonchar/emmofret/blob/development/lib/responders/redux-handler.js). This gave possibility to use es6 all over the server app but it was not the main purpose of this boilerplate. And now with Node.js v4 it(ES6) can be used without `babel` in general. But this is another story. 

### Server architecture and helpers
---
#### Configuration
For multi environment configuration used [konphyg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/konphyg). The key feature of this approach is to put only __difference__ in new env config file:

config/server.json

 ```json
{
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": "3020",
  "uploadsDir": "uploads/",
  "api": {
    "mountPoint":"/api"
  }
} 
 ```
 
config/server.test.json

 ```json
{
  "port": "3021"
}
 ```

Usually you will need to store different API keys somewhere. And `secrets.json` is used for this. It's git ignored by default and nothing will be committed to the repo. You need just create and update this file manually on every environment where you plan to use this app.

#### Logger
On the top of `bunyan` JSON logging module `bunyan-format` is used to make logs human friendly on dev environment. You can adjust log serializers in [logger.js](https://github.com/aleksey-gonchar/emmofret/blob/development/lib/logger.js) 

#### API helpers

##### CRUD
To make api endpoint creation easy and really fast [buildCRUD.js](https://github.com/aleksey-gonchar/emmofret/blob/development/lib/api-helpers/buildCRUD.js) helper is used. It has predefined set of mapped actions and automatically apply it for defined model:

```javascript
var apiHelpers = requireTree('../lib/api-helpers')
var User = $require('models/user')

module.exports = function (router) {
  router.use('/users', apiHelpers.buildCRUD(User))
}
```

In this example we've defined CRUD actions for `User` resource mounted on `/users` of `router` mount point.
 
Also we can disable any action and define `pre-` & `post-` filter for actions.


```javascript
var apiHelpers = requireTree('../lib/api-helpers')
var User = $require('models/user')

module.exports = function (router) {
  router.use('/users', apiHelpers.buildCRUD(User, {
    actions: {
      'pre-list': apiHelpers.allowLogged,
      'pre-retrieve': apiHelpers.allowLogged,
      'pre-patch': apiHelpers.allowLogged,
      'pre-remove': apiHelpers.allowLogged,
      update: false
    }
  }))
}
```

You can use array of functions in `pre-` and `post-`. Complete set of predefined mapping is:
 
* `create` -> `POST`
* `list`-> `GET`
* `retrieve` -> `GET /:objectId`
* `retrieve-set` -> `GET /$idListRegExp` : `/([0-9a-fA-F;]{25,256})/` reg exp used to determine object id set in query and serve it in one request and response. Usefull for `backbone` style client model organisation.
* `update` -> `PUT /:objectId`
* `remove` -> `DELETE /:objectId`
* `patch` -> `PATCH /:objectId`


__Note__: `objectId` when defined in action mapping will be availabale in `req.params.objectId`

To populate some fields of result `populate` option of `buildCRUD` is used:

```
var apiHelpers = requireTree('../lib/api-helpers')
var User = $require('models/user')

module.exports = function (router) {
  router.use('/users', apiHelpers.buildCRUD(User, {
    actions: {
      update: false
    },
    populate: ['prop1', 'prop2']
  }))
}
```
##### allowLogged helper
Binded JWT [middleware](https://github.com/aleksey-gonchar/emmofret/blob/development/routes/auth/jwt.js) automatically transforms request token to `req.session.userId` and then `allowLogged` helper check for proper user or respond with [not-authorized](https://github.com/aleksey-gonchar/emmofret/blob/development/lib/api-err-responders/not-authorized.js) error.

In this way it can be used in `pre-` hook for any non-public api's.

#### Views
Handlebars used as main template engine, but it can be easily replaced with what you want.

Main html meta tags are set via [redux-handler.js](https://github.com/aleksey-gonchar/emmofret/blob/development/lib/responders/redux-handler.js) from `package.json`

#### Responders
Every incoming request to the server passing through all the middlewares and routers. And when target route handler is defined and does his job at the end it just call `next()`. Or if some error occurs then handler will call `next(err)`. In such a way we put at the very end of middleware chain 3 main responders:

1. [redux-handler.js](https://github.com/aleksey-gonchar/emmofret/blob/development/lib/responders/redux-handler.js) - it dedicated to catch all `/app` request and serve it as `html` page with prefetched state and layout. All client side javascript loaded by reference in `head`. So it very usefull for indexing by search engines.
* [err-handlers.js](https://github.com/aleksey-gonchar/emmofret/blob/development/lib/responders/err-handlers.js) - will catch all `next(err)` calls. It mean all catched error will be processed to the client with error message.
* [send-response.js](https://github.com/aleksey-gonchar/emmofret/blob/development/lib/responders/send-response.js) - will send to client content of `res.body` as JSON with `res.code` status.

This approach give us ability to process response body trhough couple of hooks. And have only single `exit`-point from server.

To simplify common error repsonses usage there is a couple of predefined error responders which are just wrapper for specific kind of error message and status:

* [not-authorized.js](https://github.com/aleksey-gonchar/emmofret/blob/development/lib/api-err-responders/not-authorized.js)
* [not-enough-permissions.js](https://github.com/aleksey-gonchar/emmofret/blob/development/lib/api-err-responders/not-enough-permissions.js)
* [resource-not-found.js](https://github.com/aleksey-gonchar/emmofret/blob/development/lib/api-err-responders/resource-not-found.js)

For exmaple let's take a look on `allowLogged` api helper:
```javascript
var $require = require(process.cwd() + '/lib/require')
var User = $require('models/user')
var errResNotFound = require('../api-err-responders/resource-not-found')
var errResNotAuthorized = require('../api-err-responders/not-authorized')

module.exports = function allowLogged (req, res, next) {
  if (!req.session.userId) {
    return next(errResNotAuthorized())
  }

  if (!req.user) {
    User.findById(req.session.userId, function (err, user) {
      if (err) return next(err)
      if (!user) return next(errResNotFound(req.session.userId, 'User'))
      req.user = user
      next()
    })
  } else {
    next()
  }
}
```

When user is not authorized we use `not-authorized` and when there is no such user found - `resource-not-found` error responder.



### Client architecture and helpers
---
Redux app architecture is clear and extensible enough, so you can find all its part in `/src/front-end/js` with small difference described below. 

#### Constants

Constants lives in single file to not to produce a lot of small files. Custom `keyMirror` function is applyed to  key tree - when there is already a value set for key - it ignored. This is convenient for api call state constants:

```javascript
{
    FETCH_APP_STATE: {
      REQUEST: 'FETCH_APP_STATE_REQUEST',
      SUCCESS: 'FETCH_APP_STATE_SUCCESS',
      ERROR: 'FETCH_APP_STATE_ERROR'
    }
}
```

#### Router and routes

Routes resides in single file `routes.js` where all layout components imported. Universal router resides in `router.js` and here is router started logic is applayed in such a way that this module can be imported both in client start script `index.js` and in server `redux-handler.js`.

#### App state prefetch

In most cases your app will need some server data to have in app state before to render. So you can write static method `fetchState` for you class and it will be called on router start. It's very usefull for server render - you can fetch some data and render in one request.

```javascript
  //  inside of App class definition
  static fetchState (store, params, query) {
    if (isFetched(store.getState())) {
      return Promise.resolve()
    } else {
      return Promise.all([store.dispatch(AppActions.fetchState(params, query))])
    }
  }
```

#### Containers
In terms of React DOM architecture we have couple of basic containers to wrap in default logic:

* `containers/App.js` - application itself. The root app component
* `containers/ModalsContainer.js` - container to manage popup windows.
* `containers/RouterContainer.js` - wrapper for router to bind auth check logic.


#### Application store

App store is constructed from middlewares and reducers in `store.js`. Please note that global consts `__CLIENT__` and other are defined for server and client rendering in different places. When script is running in browser - they set via webpack bundle. And when on server - as `GLOBAL` constants.

#### API middleware
There is also simple middleware to make API call from actions in async manner with promises. To make api call you need to define special actons type:
```javascript
{
    FETCH_APP_STATE: {
      REQUEST: 'FETCH_APP_STATE_REQUEST',
      SUCCESS: 'FETCH_APP_STATE_SUCCESS',
      ERROR: 'FETCH_APP_STATE_ERROR'
    }
}
```
And dispatch `FETCH_APP_STATE` with API url:

```javascript
store.dispatch({
	type: FETCH_APP_STATE,
	payload: '/users/current'
})
```

Middleware then will dispatch `REQUEST` action with no payload and return promise so you can wait for finish of request execution. Then `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` will be dispatched with corresponding payload. And you need not to forget to implement reducers for all this 3 actions: `REQUEST`, `SUCCESS`, `ERROR`.
